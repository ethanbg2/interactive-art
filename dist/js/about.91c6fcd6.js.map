In weekly meetings (Tuesdays at 6pm), we learn about real-world examples of computer-human interaction in current technology, and then engage in discussions and work on our main project for this year: a tool that produces sound/music from an art/picture, depending on where a person is looking at the artwork. </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n\r\n    <h1>Details About This Project </h1>\r\n    <p> This project takes in human-interactive input via an eye tracker, uses the input to select an area of an image, and matches the average color of that area to a specific sound. To accomplish this, our SIG was divided into 4 sub-teams: one dedicated for the eye tracker functionality, one for the user interface, one for infra, and one for image-music conversion.</p>\r\n    <br>\r\n\r\n    <h1>Links</h1>\r\n    <p> ACM Website: https://acm.illinois.edu/ </p>\r\n    <p> SIGCHI Website: https://sigchi.acm.illinois.edu/ </p>\r\n    <br>\r\n    \r\n    <h1> Info About Members</h1>\r\n    <p>Lead: Abhimanyu Thosar, Mitchell Bifeld, Swathi Ram, Jeffrey Tsai</p>\r\n    <p>UI Team: Aditi, Will, Rohith, Karthik, Mari, Ethan, Mitchell</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n","import { render } from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=template&id=7a56d01a\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport exportComponent from \"C:\\\\Users\\\\ethan\\\\Documents\\\\School\\\\sigchi\\\\interactive-art\\\\node_modules\\\\vue-loader\\\\dist\\\\exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_hoisted_2","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_1","script","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
